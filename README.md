This is my personal portfolio website, built using Next.js, Tailwind CSS, and designed to showcase my projects, skills, and experiences.

I'm Usha, an international student at the University of Toronto, double majoring in Computer Science and Economics. I'm passionate about blending data, design, AI, and finance to create intelligent solutions with beautiful interfaces. This website is a reflection of my journey and the projects I've worked on.
