### My Contribution
As part of a summer internship when I went home for the summer of first year, I returned to KOOMPI, this time to work on one of their projects to create a metaverse - Kumandra. 

Initially, I worked on helping debug and edit Three.js code concerning the movement of a character in the website. There was an issue with how characters could not turn 360 degrees without glitching. Fresh out of math class, I used calculus to solve and optimise this!

However, I also focused on redesigning the navigation page and pitching a new branding look, as well as recoding the navigation page in React. I also got to work on connecting the wallet within Kumandra to Selendra (KOOMPI's sister blockchain company), for digital land purchases, using Web3.js and lots of testing.
