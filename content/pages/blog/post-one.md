i'm a cambodian-indian student, and i'm currently ~~going through it~~ in my third year at uoft, canada.

fun fact: canada is the 6th country i have lived in!

i like toooo many things and i am indecisive, which make for an interesting combination. some of the main things i am passionate about are design and data!

design-wise, i've always been in love with aesthetics and "making things pretty", as seen through my extensive experience as a pinterest board connoisseur (8+ years and counting!). this led me to begin playing around with website/app design from trying to edit the html/css of my tumblr blog in 7th grade, to being here on read.cv. it's been a journey!

and as for data, this is more of an accidental discovery: i took a first-year stats class (sta107) and ending up finding it quite interesting. coupled with some very interesting econ lectures and coffee chats with people in risk/audit analysis, i was inspired! my (emerging) passion for data is heavily intertwined with my curiousity of financial economics. i'll write more as i learn more! for now, i'm still expanding my horizons through more coffee chats, more google searches and professor office hours.

alright, enough about me. i hope this was an intro interesting enough for you to reach out!
