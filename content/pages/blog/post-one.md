I'm a cambodian-indian student currently ~~going through it~~ in my third year at UofT.

Fun fact: Canada is the 6th country I have lived in!

I like toooo many things and I'm indecisive, which make for an interesting combination. Some of the main things I am passionate about are design and data!

Design-wise, I've always been in love with aesthetics and "making things pretty", as seen through my extensive experience as a Pinterest board connoisseur (8+ years and counting!). This led me to begin playing around with website/app design from trying to edit the html/css of my tumblr blog in 6th grade, to being a SWE intern. It's been a journey!

And as for data, this is more of an accidental discovery: I took a first-year stats class (STA107) and ending up finding it quite interesting. Coupled with some very interesting Economics lectures and coffee chats with people in risk/audit analysis, I was inspired! My (emerging) passion for data is heavily intertwined with my curiousity of financial economics. I'll write more as i learn more! for now, I'm still expanding my horizons through more coffee chats, more google searches and professor office hours.

Alright, enough about me. I hope this was an intro interesting enough for you to reach out!

Signing off,

Usha
