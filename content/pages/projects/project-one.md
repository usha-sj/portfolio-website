### Project Overview
- **Team Collaboration:** Partnered with two teammates to program real-time communication and control systems for Kobuki robots.
- **Control Algorithms:** Enhanced movement precision by fine-tuning speed, turning radius, and responsiveness, achieving a 20% increase in control accuracy.
- **Socket Communication:** Established seamless robot-to-robot communication using socket-based networking to enable strategic teamwork and positioning.
- **Technology Stack:** Raspberry Pi, Python, Socket Programming, and Robot Operating System (ROS).

> “Collaborating with robots teaches you more than programming—it teaches you precision, creativity, and teamwork.”

The project culminated in successful participation in UTM Robotics’ internal tournaments, demonstrating improved robot agility, responsiveness, and strategic coordination.
