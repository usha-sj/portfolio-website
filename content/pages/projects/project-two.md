### Project Overview
Github: https://github.com/nitic04/PhishNet
Devpost Link: https://devpost.com/software/phishnet-ejy6n3 
Website: https://phishnet.co/

### About
PhishNet is a website that allows users to upload their exported emails onto the website, which will then scan the file information and give the user a rating or percentage of how trustworthy or legitimate the email senders are, how suspicious they or the links they send are, and as well as checking if any similar scam has been reported.

### Design Process
For Deerhacks III, I worked with my friend Niti to design and implement the website. While I was mostly responsible for the initial design, logo, and front-end development, Niti handled the back-end.
