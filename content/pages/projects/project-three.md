Rentals 4 Real is a platform which automates the rental search process. When creating R4R, we took into account factors that might shape one's renting needs, such as accessibility, efficiency, and our personal experiences and frustrations as university students trying to rent off-campus housing. R4R is meant to support those needs by providing a faster, more personalized approach to house-hunting. It also won Best Domain Name!

For my very first Deerhacks competition, I worked in a team of 4, with my friends Ido and Niti, and our peer from UWaterloo, Justin. I successfully pitched the idea of a rental website catered exclusively to university students, inspired by my own struggles to find off-campus housing as first year came to a close. 

I designed the logo and created the logo and Figma mockup which served as the foundation of our website design. I also worked on the front-end with Niti, while Ido and Justin focused on backend and setting up our SMS service. Apart from the actual coding, I worked on our README (as seen in our Github repository),  filmed our "advertisement" which is in the submission video I also edited above.
