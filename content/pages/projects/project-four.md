### Project Overview
As part of my internship (and subsequent officer role) in Smallworld Ltd. and KOOMPI, I assisted with the restructuring of Weteka, an online learning platform catered towards Cambodian schools. As I was the youngest member of the Smallworld team - as well as the only one in high school - I was able to provide UI/UX testing and feedback, as well as designing the navigation in English and translating to Khmer.
